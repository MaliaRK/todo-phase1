# Todo Application Constitution – Phase I

## Core Principles

### Todo Application Core Principles
This project implements **Phase I** of the "Evolution of Todo" hackathon. The objective is to build an **in-memory Python console-based Todo application** using **Spec-Driven Development** with **Claude Code** and **Spec-Kit Plus**. All development must adhere to written specifications and maintain clean architecture with separation of concerns.

### Product Architect Development Philosophy
The developer acts as a **Product Architect**. All implementation must be generated from specifications. Manual code writing is strictly prohibited. Specifications are refined until correct output is achieved. This ensures intentional, well-designed solutions that meet user needs.

### Claude Code Generation Mandate
No manual code writing is allowed. All code must be generated by Claude Code. This ensures consistency, reduces human error, and maintains traceability from specifications to implementation. Any code created outside of Claude Code violates this principle. This mandate supports the Spec-Driven Development approach.

### Technology Stack Requirements
The project must use the specified technology stack: UV (Python environment and package manager), Python 3.13+, Claude Code, and Spec-Kit Plus. This ensures consistency across the development environment and leverages the appropriate tools for Spec-Driven Development.

### Spec-Driven Development Compliance
Development must follow written specifications. Every feature, function, and component must be defined in a specification document before implementation. This ensures that development is intentional, testable, and aligned with project goals. Specifications are refined until correct output is achieved.

### Project Structure Rules
All source code must reside inside a `/src` directory. Logic must be modular and split by responsibility. This ensures clean separation of concerns and maintainable code organization. This structure promotes modularity and clear boundaries between different components.

## Application Constraints
Application must be console-based (CLI) with all data stored **in memory only**. No database, file storage, or external services are allowed. Clean separation of concerns is mandatory. Python version must be 3.13+. These constraints ensure simplicity, portability, and focus on core functionality without external dependencies.

## Quality Standards
Code must be clean, readable, and maintainable with modular structure and clear function responsibilities. The application must provide clear CLI prompts and outputs with friendly error handling. No global mutable state leakage is allowed. These standards ensure maintainable, user-friendly code that follows best practices.

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. All amendments to this constitution must be documented with proper approval and include a migration plan for existing code. All pull requests and code reviews must verify compliance with these principles. Any complexity introduced must be justified against these core principles. Use this constitution as the primary guidance for all development decisions.
