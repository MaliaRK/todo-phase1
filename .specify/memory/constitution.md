# Global Todo Application Constitution – All Phases (I-V)

## Core Principles

### Global Todo Application Evolution Principles
This project implements the "Evolution of Todo" hackathon across **Five Architectural Phases** (I → V). The objective is to evolve a simple todo management system from an in-memory console application to a cloud-native, event-driven AI system. Each phase introduces new architecture and technologies while preserving the **core business domain: Todo Management**. All development must adhere to written specifications and maintain clean architecture with separation of concerns throughout the evolution.

### Product Architect Development Philosophy
The developer acts as a **Product Architect**. All implementation must be generated from specifications. Manual code writing is strictly prohibited. Specifications are refined until correct output is achieved. This ensures intentional, well-designed solutions that meet user needs across all phases of evolution.

### Claude Code Generation Mandate
No manual code writing is allowed. All code must be generated by Claude Code. This ensures consistency, reduces human error, and maintains traceability from specifications to implementation across all phases. Any code created outside of Claude Code violates this principle. This mandate supports the Spec-Driven Development approach throughout the evolution.

### Phase-Specific Technology Stack Requirements
Each phase must use its designated technology stack without introducing future-phase technologies prematurely:
- Phase I: Python 3.13+, UV, Console I/O
- Phase II: Next.js, FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon DB
- Phase III: OpenAI ChatKit, Agents SDK, MCP SDK
- Phase IV: Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Minikube
- Phase V: Kafka, Dapr, DigitalOcean Kubernetes
Claude Code must always respect the **current phase's tech stack** without introducing future-phase technologies prematurely.

### Spec-Driven Development Compliance
Development must follow written specifications in all phases. Every feature, function, and component must be defined in a specification document before implementation. This ensures that development is intentional, testable, and aligned with project goals across the entire evolution. Specifications are refined until correct output is achieved in each phase.

### Multi-Phase Repository Structure Rules
A **single Git repository** is used for all phases. Each phase MUST live in its **own dedicated Git branch**. Phases must NOT be merged into each other. This ensures clean separation between different architectural implementations while maintaining a unified project history and evolution path.

## Phase Transition Requirements
When transitioning between phases, the following requirements must be met:
- All code from the previous phase must remain accessible in its dedicated branch
- New phase implementation must start fresh using the designated technology stack
- Core business domain (Todo Management) must be preserved and enhanced
- Specifications must be updated to reflect new phase requirements
- Quality standards must be maintained or improved in each subsequent phase

## Production-Grade Standards
Across all phases, the system must maintain professional quality standards:
- Readable, maintainable, and well-structured code
- No dead code or unused abstractions
- Meaningful naming conventions
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Clear startup and usage instructions per phase
- Updated specifications and history documentation
- Phase-appropriate diagrams or explanations

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines across all phases. All amendments to this constitution must be documented with proper approval and include a migration plan for existing code. All pull requests and code reviews must verify compliance with these principles. Any complexity introduced must be justified against these core principles. Use this constitution as the primary guidance for all development decisions throughout the evolution. This constitution governs **all present and future decisions** in this repository across all five phases.
