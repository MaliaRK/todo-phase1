# Feature Specification: Phase II - Full-Stack Todo Web Application

**Feature Branch**: `004-fullstack-todo-app`
**Created**: 2026-01-04
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "You are Claude Code acting as the **Lead Full-Stack Architect** for **Phase II: Full-Stack Web Application** of the project: **"The Evolution of Todo – Spec-Driven Cloud-Native AI System"**"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Create and View Tasks (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to create new todo tasks and view all my existing tasks through a web interface so that I can manage my tasks efficiently without using the command line.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that provides the primary value of the todo application. Without the ability to create and view tasks, no other functionality matters.

**Independent Test**: The system can be tested by creating a new task through the web interface and then viewing the list of all tasks to confirm it appears. This delivers the fundamental value of the todo application.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on the todo application web page, **When** I enter a task title and description and click "Create Task", **Then** the new task appears in the task list.
2. **Given** I have multiple tasks in the system, **When** I navigate to the task list page, **Then** I see all my tasks displayed with their titles and descriptions.

### User Story 2 - Update and Delete Tasks (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to update task details and delete tasks that are no longer needed so that I can keep my task list current and accurate.

**Why this priority**: These operations are essential for maintaining an effective todo list. Users need to be able to modify and remove tasks as their needs change.

**Independent Test**: The system can be tested by updating an existing task's details and verifying the changes are saved, or by deleting a task and confirming it no longer appears in the list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have an existing task, **When** I edit its title or description and save the changes, **Then** the updated information is reflected in the task list.
2. **Given** I have a task in my list, **When** I click the delete button for that task, **Then** the task is removed from the task list.

---

### User Story 3 - Mark Tasks as Complete/Incomplete (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete or incomplete so that I can track my progress and know what still needs to be done.

**Why this priority**: This is a core todo application feature that enables users to track their progress and prioritize their work effectively.

**Independent Test**: The system can be tested by marking a task as complete and verifying its status changes, then marking it as incomplete again to confirm the toggle works both ways.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have an incomplete task, **When** I mark it as complete, **Then** the task appears with a completed status (e.g., crossed out or checkmark).
2. **Given** I have a completed task, **When** I mark it as incomplete, **Then** the task returns to an active/incomplete status.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to create a task with an empty title?
- How does the system handle very long task descriptions or titles?
- What happens when the database is temporarily unavailable during operations?
- How does the system handle concurrent updates to the same task by different users?
- What happens when a user tries to update or delete a task that no longer exists?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain professional quality standards across all phases
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide a fully decoupled frontend and backend architecture
- **FR-013**: System MUST communicate via HTTP APIs only (no direct database access from frontend)
- **FR-014**: System MUST persist all data using a relational database
- **FR-015**: System MUST expose clear REST endpoints for all todo operations
- **FR-016**: System MUST support all Phase I features via the web interface

- **FR-021**: System MUST authenticate users via standard web authentication methods (session-based or token-based)
- **FR-022**: System MUST retain user data for the duration of their account existence with standard data retention policies


### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Task**: The primary entity representing a todo item with attributes including title, description, completion status, creation timestamp, and update timestamp
- **User**: The entity representing a person using the system (if authentication is implemented)

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can create a new task in under 10 seconds from landing on the application
- **SC-002**: System displays task list within 2 seconds of page load under normal network conditions
- **SC-003**: 95% of users successfully complete the primary task operations (create, view, update, delete, mark complete) on first attempt
- **SC-004**: System handles at least 100 concurrent users without performance degradation
- **SC-005**: 99% of user requests return successful responses under normal operating conditions
- **SC-006**: Users can update task status (complete/incomplete) with less than 1 second feedback time
- **SC-007**: Task data persists reliably with 99.9% data integrity over a 30-day period
- **SC-008**: Application is accessible and functional across major web browsers
