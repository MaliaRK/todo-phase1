# Implementation Plan: Todo Application CLI

**Branch**: `002-todo-cli-app` | **Date**: 2025-12-31 | **Spec**: [specs/002-todo-cli-app/spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-todo-cli-app/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implementation of a Python console-based Todo application with in-memory storage. The application provides core todo functionality including adding, viewing, updating, deleting, and marking tasks as complete/incomplete. The system follows clean architecture principles with separation of concerns across data models, business logic, and CLI interface layers. All code will be generated by Claude Code following Spec-Driven Development methodology.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13+
**Primary Dependencies**: UV package manager, Claude Code, Spec-Kit Plus
**Storage**: In-memory only (no file/database persistence)
**Testing**: pytest for unit and integration testing
**Target Platform**: Console/CLI application
**Project Type**: Single Python application with /src directory structure
**Performance Goals**: Response time under 1 second for all commands, support for at least 100 tasks in memory
**Constraints**: Console-based, in-memory storage, no external services, no global mutable state leakage
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user console application supporting basic todo operations

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Code generation must be performed by Claude Code (no manual code writing)
- Implementation must follow written specifications from spec.md
- Developer acts as Product Architect (intentional design)
- Technology stack: UV, Python 3.13+, Claude Code, Spec-Kit Plus
- Clean architecture and separation of concerns must be maintained
- All source code must reside in /src directory with modular logic
- Memory-only storage (no file/database persistence) as per constraints
- Console-based interaction only (no GUI/web interface)
- No global mutable state leakage allowed

### Source Code (repository root)
<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the placeholder tree below with the concrete layout
  for this feature. Delete unused options and expand the chosen structure with
  real paths (e.g., apps/admin, packages/something). The delivered plan must
  not include Option labels.

├── models.py          # Task entity definition and data models
├── storage.py         # In-memory storage and task collection management

├── cli.py             # Command-line interface and input parsing
└── main.py            # Application entry point and command loop


**Structure Decision**: Single Python application with modular architecture following separation of concerns. All source code resides in /src directory as per constitution requirement. The structure includes models.py for data entities, storage.py for in-memory management, services.py for business logic, cli.py for command parsing, and main.py for application entry point.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
