# Todo Application CLI Implementation Plan

## Prompt Text

```
Your task is to convert the **approved Phase I specification**
into a **clear, step-by-step implementation plan**
that Claude Code can follow to generate the application.

---

## Inputs
- Constitution.md (Phase I)
- Final Phase I Specification
- Technology Stack:
  - UV
  - Python 3.13+
  - Claude Code
  - Spec-Kit Plus

---

## Objective
Produce a **detailed implementation plan** that:
- Breaks the system into logical steps
- Maps each step to files inside `/src`
- Defines responsibilities per module
- Respects all architectural and tooling constraints

---

## Planning Rules
- Do NOT s

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- Every required feature is mapped to a plan step
- Every Python file in `/src` has a clear responsibility
- Plan is complete enough for direct code generation
- No ambiguity remains for Claude Code

---

## Deliverablewrite any code
- Do NOT invent new features
- Follow the specification exactly
- Assume all code will be generated by Claude Code
- Ensure `/src` directory usage

---

## Required Plan Structure

### 1. Project Setup
- UV environment initialization
- Python runtime verification
- Folder structure creation (`/src`)

### 2. Data Modeling
- Define Task entity structure
- Responsibility: `models.py`

### 3. In-Memory Storage Design
- Task collection management
- ID generation strategy
- Responsibility: `storage.py`

### 4. Business Logic Layer
- Add task
- Update task
- Delete task
- Toggle completion
- Responsibility: `services.py`

### 5. CLI Interaction Layer
- Command loop
- User input parsing
- Output formatting
- Responsibility: `main.py`

### 6. Error Handling Strategy
- Invalid command handling
- Invalid task ID handling
- Empty list handling

### 7. Execution Flow
- Application startup sequence
- Command lifecycle
- Graceful exit

---

## Output Format
Return the plan in **well-structured Markdown** usin
Return **only the implementation plan**.
Do **NOT** generate code.
Do **NOT** modify the specification.
```

## Response Text

Created comprehensive implementation plan for the Todo Application CLI including: plan.md with project structure, research.md with technical decisions, data-model.md with entity definitions, quickstart.md with usage instructions, and contracts directory. The plan maps each feature to specific Python files in the /src directory following clean architecture principles.

## Outcome

Successfully created a complete implementation plan that maps all required features to specific files and responsibilities in the /src directory.

## Evaluation

The implementation plan is complete with all required artifacts generated. The plan follows the specification exactly, respects architectural constraints, and is ready for code generation by Claude Code.
